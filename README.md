# RapidSpike RCA Library

This repository includes example scripts for various uses of RCA monitors.

It's intended to enable users to setup and install RCA monitors without writing the scripts themselves.

## Usage

### Install
Run the following command and follow the instructions:

`python install.py`

This will ask you for your RapidSpike login details and information around which script you wish to install. Once the new script is configured, it'll be ran for the first time and added to a 'run list'. The run list is then used for scheduling subsequent tests.

### Uninstall
To remove a configured script, just run this command and follow the instructions.

`python uninstall.py`
